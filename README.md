# Real-time Plant Disease Detection and Pesticide Application System with IoT and AI
This project proposes an intelligent system for automated plant disease detection and targeted pesticide application utilizing the power of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

System Design:

Image Capture: A Raspberry Pi 2 serves as the core, equipped with a camera module to capture real-time images of plants at regular intervals.

Disease Detection:

Dual Model Approach: The system employs two independent disease detection models:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A pre-trained CNN model analyzes captured images. CNNs excel at image recognition and can effectively identify various plant diseases with high accuracy.
OpenCV-based Model: This model leverages OpenCV, a computer vision library, to detect specific features associated with plant diseases. It provides an alternative approach for disease identification.
Benefits of Dual Model: This dual approach offers robustness. If one model encounters challenges, the other can still potentially identify the disease.

Pesticide Application: Upon disease detection by either model, the system triggers a mechanism to automatically apply a measured amount of pesticide to the affected plant. This ensures timely intervention and minimizes disease spread.

Cloud Integration (Thingsboard): The system leverages the Thingsboard cloud platform for data transmission. Every stage of the process, from image capture to disease detection and potential pesticide application, is communicated to the cloud. This enables:

Real-time Monitoring: Farmers can remotely monitor the system's operation and plant health status through a user-friendly interface.
Data Logging and Analysis: The cloud stores valuable data for historical analysis. This data can be used to identify disease patterns, optimize pesticide usage, and improve overall crop management strategies.
Project Advantages:

Early Disease Detection: The system facilitates real-time disease identification, enabling prompt action to prevent significant crop loss.
Targeted Pesticide Application: Automatic pesticide application based on confirmed disease presence minimizes waste and environmental impact.
Remote Monitoring and Data Analytics: Cloud integration allows for convenient monitoring and data-driven decision making for improved farm management.
This project presents a promising approach towards precision agriculture by combining the strengths of IoT and AI. It has the potential to revolutionize plant disease management, leading to increased crop yields, reduced reliance on pesticides, and improved farm efficiency.
